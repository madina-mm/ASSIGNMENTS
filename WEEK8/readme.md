## Week 8 ##

In this code, a queue system is designed for QelizXidmet - a not so successful competitor to AsanXidmet. At QelizXidmet instead of making their customers' queuing experience as easy as possible they do the opposite. The basic text based UI and underlying queue sytsem are designed. Queue system has some features:
The UI lets the operator enter any name and that person is chosen as a lucky customer.
Every time a person is selected as the lucky customer they are moved to the back of the queue.
The ui also lets the operator to type "admit" which admits the first person in the queue into QelizXidmet therefore removing that person from the queue.
